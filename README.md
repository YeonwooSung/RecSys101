## Collaborative Filtering

### 1. User-based Collaborative Filtering

User-based Collaborative Filtering is a method that recommends items to a user that similar users have liked. The basic idea behind this recommender is that users who agreed in the past will agree again in the future. This method is based on the "wisdom of the crowd" principle. The system matches each user to other users that are similar based on the items they have in common and then recommends items that these similar users liked. The system can recommend items to a user by computing a similarity score between that user and every other user, and then recommending the items with the highest predicted ratings.

### 2. Item-based Collaborative Filtering

Item-based Collaborative Filtering is a method that recommends items to a user that similar items have been liked by. The basic idea behind this recommender is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it. This method is based on the "wisdom of the crowd" principle. The system matches each item to other items that are similar based on the users who have liked them and then recommends items that these similar items have been liked by. The system can recommend items to a user by computing a similarity score between that item and every other item, and then recommending the items with the highest predicted ratings.

### 3. Matrix Factorization

Matrix Factorization is a method that decomposes a user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices. The basic idea behind this recommender is that if we can find two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices, we can reconstruct the original user-item interaction matrix. This method is based on the "wisdom of the crowd" principle. The system matches each user to other users that are similar based on the items they have in common and then recommends items that these similar users liked. The system can recommend items to a user by computing a similarity score between that user and every other user, and then recommending the items with the highest predicted ratings.

### 4. Singular Value Decomposition

Singular Value Decomposition is a method that decomposes a user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices. The basic idea behind this recommender is that if we can find two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices, we can reconstruct the original user-item interaction matrix. This method is based on the "wisdom of the crowd" principle.

The system can recommend items to a user by computing a similarity score between that user and every other user, and then recommending the items with the highest predicted ratings.

### 6. Non-negative Matrix Factorization

Non-negative Matrix Factorization is a method that decomposes a user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices.

The system can recommend items to a user by computing a similarity score between that user and every other user, and then recommending the items with the highest predicted ratings.

### 7. Neural Collaborative Filtering

Neural Collaborative Filtering is a method that decomposes a user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices. The basic idea behind this recommender is that if we can find two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices, we can reconstruct the original user-item interaction matrix. This method is based on the "wisdom of the crowd" principle. The system matches each user to other users that are similar based on the items they have in common and then recommends items that these similar users liked. The system can recommend items to a user by computing a similarity score between that user and every other user, and then recommending the items with the highest predicted ratings.

## Content-based Filtering

### 1. TF-IDF

TF-IDF is a method that recommends items to a user based on the similarity between the content of the items and the content of the user's profile. The basic idea behind this recommender is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it. This method is based on the "wisdom of the crowd" principle. The system matches each item to other items that are similar based on the users who have liked them and then recommends items that these similar items have been liked by. The system can recommend items to a user by computing a similarity score between that item and every other item, and then recommending the items with the highest predicted ratings.

### 2. Word2Vec

Word2Vec is a method that recommends items to a user based on the similarity between the content of the items and the content of the user's profile.

## Evaluation Metrics

### 1. Mean Absolute Error

Mean Absolute Error is a metric that measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight.

### 2. Mean Squared Error

Mean Squared Error is a metric that measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. It is the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation.

### 3. Root Mean Squared Error

Root Mean Squared Error is a metric that measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is the square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation.

### 4. Mean Absolute Percentage Error

Mean Absolute Percentage Error is a metric that measures the average magnitude of the percentage errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is the average over the test sample of the absolute percentage differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight.

### 5. Mean Squared Percentage Error

Mean Squared Percentage Error is a metric that measures the average of the squares of the percentage errors—that is, the average squared percentage difference between the estimated values and the actual value. It is the average of squared percentage differences between prediction and actual observation.

### 6. Root Mean Squared Percentage Error

Root Mean Squared Percentage Error is a metric that measures the average magnitude of the percentage errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is the square root of the average of squared percentage differences between prediction and actual observation.
